# Daily Chat <img src="assets/images/appicon.png" width="80" height="80"/>

## ðŸ’£Problem:
Due to current Scenario, most of the colleges runs online and new college students don't even get a chance to interact with seniors and teachers. This increases the gap between college new students and teachers. 

## âœˆSolution:
In order to reduce the gap between the new college students we have to bring all the school alumni, all teachers and all Students over a single platform. This application helps students to ask their doubts and create a chatroom specifically with another person or with the group. 

## ðŸ˜®Wow Factor
This project works on cross platform i.e natively available for both iOS and Android users, its has realtime live video confrencing with end to end chat encryption so that even the DB admin cannot read the chats. One can easily schedule any kind of group chat or have live video cofrencing and clear their doubts instantly.
